# Supermarket Check-Out System

This project is a check-out system implemented in Java with threads. It was developed during the 2nd year of study to simulate a real-life scenario at a supermarket, where customers go to pay for their items. The goal of the application is to optimize the process by directing customers to the check-out register with the shortest line.

## Overview

The Supermarket Check-Out System replicates the process of customers paying for their items at a supermarket. It employs Java threads to manage multiple customers concurrently and simulates the dynamics of check-out lines.

## Features

- Implementation of a check-out system in Java.
- Utilization of threads to manage concurrent customer interactions.
- Optimization of customer flow by directing them to the shortest check-out line.

## Usage

To use the Supermarket Check-Out System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source files using your preferred Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled Java application.
4. Follow the prompts to simulate the check-out process and observe the optimization of customer flow.
